### Sprint management

The master branch shall be protected such that it can only be modified via pull request requiring a review, so commits cannot be pushed to it directly in error.

At the start of each new sprint the scrum master will create a sprint branch from master.  This branch shall be protected such that it can only be modified via pull request requiring a review, so commits cannot be pushed to it directly in error.

The scrum team members shall create their own unprotected working branches from the sprint branch.  When development of a feature or bug fix is complete, the scrum team member shall create a pull request to merge their working branch back into the sprint branch which will be reviewed by the scrum master prior to committing the merge.  The scrum master will inform the scrum team of any updates to the sprint branch during a sprint.

At the end of the sprint, the scrum master shall merge the sprint branch into master.

### Help

Any problems, suggestions or questions please contact the scrum master.
